# Food-and-Exercise-Reccomend-for-Diabetes
This project is a Jupyter Notebook (RL_Project_(2).ipynb) that implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model for personalized diabetes management. It begins by installing essential libraries like stable_baselines3 for RL and importing dependencies such as numpy, pandas, and gym for data handling and simulation. The notebook loads datasets (food1.csv, food.csv, doctors_list.csv) containing nutritional and medical information to support its recommendation system. The core functionality includes blood sugar level analysis, where the model categorizes levels as low, normal, or high and provides tailored food and exercise recommendations. For instance, low sugar triggers warnings about dizziness and suggests glucose tablets, while high sugar prompts high-intensity workouts and medications like Metformin. The project employs the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm to simulate blood sugar fluctuations and dynamically adjust recommendations. A user interaction feature allows inputting weekly blood sugar data, with critical levels prompting doctor consultations. Visualizations enhance clarity by displaying exercise and dietary advice. Designed for healthcare applications, this project demonstrates how RL can optimize diabetes care through data-driven, adaptive suggestions. For GitHub, the notebook, datasets, and a detailed README.md (covering setup, dependencies, and usage) should be included to ensure reproducibility and collaboration. The well-documented code makes it suitable for open-source contributions or further research in AI-driven health interventions.
